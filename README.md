The first opensource groupbuying platform

## An open source groupbuying platform for local food.

Welcome to ProduceRun's source code repository.
Our goal with opening the source code is to stimulate the creation of a community of developers around a high-quality groupbuying platform.

You can see the software in action in http://www.producerun.com
The official repo is https://github.com/producerun/produceruncatarse

## Payment gateways

Currently, we support PayPal through our payment engines. Payment engines are extensions to ProduceRun that implement a specific payment gateway logic.
The current working engines are:
* PayPal
* 
Wanted payment gateways engines
*Braintree
*Stripe
*Dwolla
*Coinbase


If you have created a different payment engine to ProduceRun please contact us so we can link your engine here.
If you want to create a payment engine please join our mailing list at https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/groupbuyingdevs

## How to contribute with code

Before contributing, take a look at our Roadmap (https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/427075) and discuss your plans in our mailing list (https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/groupbuyingdevs).

Our pivotal is concerned with user visible features using user stories. But we do have some features not visible to users that are planned such as:
* Turn ProduceRun into a Rails Engine with customizable views.
* Make a installer script to guide users through initial ProduceRun configuration.

After that, just fork the project, change what you want, and send us a pull request.

### Best practices (or how to get your pull request accepted faster)

* Follow this style guide: https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide
* Create one acceptance tests for each scenario of the feature you are trying to implement.
* Create model and controller tests to keep 100% of code coverage at least in the new parts that you are writing.
* Feel free to add specs to the code that is already in the repository without the proper coverage ;)
* Regard the existing tests for a style guide, we try to use implicit spec subjects and lazy evaluation as often as we can.
